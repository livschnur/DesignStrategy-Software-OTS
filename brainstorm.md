# brainstorming for project ideas

IDEA 1 

Artist branding project - Create a brand surrounding a fake artist and position them in a way that would apply to my chosen demographic.

    - Create a website mock-up surrounding them as well as a tour flier 

IDEA 2

Instagram page for beginner knitters - An account that goes step by step, extremely slowly. An alternative to informational videos on Youtube because it goes slower and allows the audience to progress at their own pace. It would teach pattens, but also have tutorials for things like a slip knot.

IDEA 3 

Protest tracker - Allows organizers to log upcoming protests in their area, alerting citizens who hope to participate in a centralized database. It would also allow the population to filter by causes that they want to support.
